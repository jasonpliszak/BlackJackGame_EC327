In order to compile the Blackjack game, one must download the Qt Creator using an internet browser. After downloading the Qt Creator and creating an account, the Blackjack application is ready to be run on any desired operating system. Thus, the user must open the project in the Qt Creator application. The most effective way to do this is to import a project from the Github repository, and copy in the url found in the given Github path. After doing this, the user should be able to build the executable on Qt Creator using the bottom left hammer icon. Once this is done, the user should press the green arrow in the bottom left corner of the application, and the Blackjack application should run on the userâ€™s end. It is important to note that the Qt Creator application requires a C++ compiler which may have to be implemented manually, as a Python compiler can sometimes be the default compiler.
